#### Date: 1/8/2023
#### Description: An API that has three controllers for three functions, linked to different files
#### Peer Reviewer: Zahid Afsar
#### Review Notes:  Your code functions well when tested. I tested it both on postman and swagger and they both return what I wanted. I one suggestion which is for the NumComparer is to have it return two statements for example 33 < 45 and also 45 > 33. Other that the code works perfecetly and you did a great job.
